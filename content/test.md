## {{< small-icon user-tie-solid >}}â €Who am I?
My name is Stefan and I am a **privacy enthusiast**. I enjoy using free software
and carefully monitoring the data that is being collected about me. The goal of
this website is to host as many instances of privacy respecting software
alternatives to mainstream apps.

## {{< small-icon linux >}}â €Why ElPengu?
Discovering **Linux** meant discovering a whole new world of possibilities for me,
in the internet space filled with data grabbers, bias presented information,
fake information, clickbait, ads and apps designed to cage my attention for
profit. So it's only fair to dedicate the name of my small place on the
internet to the penguin known as Tux, the **Linux** mascot.
