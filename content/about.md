## {{< small-icon user-tie-solid >}} Who am I?

My name is Stefan. I am a computer-science student passionate about **software freedom**, as you probably figured out by
now. In late 2019 I started my journey to improve myself, the beginning of a stoic's journey in life. I discovered that
most of my self-control problems traced back to my use of technology. After first installing Ubuntu on my desktop for
testing, I researched the Linux rabbit hole and discovered something that I wouldn't have ever considered: I am not in
control of my devices but on the contrary, _they are the ones controlling me_... After having this realisation I started
to only use **libre software**:

* Linux instead of Windows
* Matrix instead of Discord
* Invidious instead of YouTube
* Android (custom ROM) instead of IOS
* ... and more ...

Ever since, my life took a turn, having more time to spend with my family and friends, being more focused on things
that actually make me happy and meeting amazing people with the same goal as me: to escape from the corporate hell
modern technology has put us in.

During this journey I've been researching **cyber-security** a lot, because knowing how to protect your data is the
first step in taking back control online. Having to secure both my server and my personal computer taught me a lot about
networking, encryption, private and public keys and programming, so I'm excited to see what comes next.

## {{< small-icon linux >}} Why ElPengu?

I strongly believe that **everyone should have a website**, after all this is how the internet was first meant to be:
everyone would host their own homepage, email server, IRC chat, etc. Decentralisation is the key to a safer internet.

I created **elpengu.com** at first in order to host my own instances of some privacy-friendly frontends, as well as host
my Matrix homeserver. What was something designed initially to only benefit me now helps a lot of people learn about
technology, software freedom and how to protect against corporate surveillance.

The name **ElPengu** is a tribute to the **Linux mascot**, the tux. If I hadn't discovered Linux I wouldn't have
started my self-improvement journey and learn so much about computers in general. So it's only fitting that my little
place on the internet should carry its name.

## {{< small-icon server >}} What comes next?

I am willing to expand ElPengu even further, in order to inform as many people as possible about the dangers of
proprietary software and corporate surveillance. I think that, through the means of decentralisation, we can have again
an open internet that encourages knowledge, free-speech and virtue, as opposed to today's web that promotes degeneracy,
ignorance and surveillance.
