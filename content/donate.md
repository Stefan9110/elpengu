Thank you for considering donating! ðŸ˜„

Currently, you can only donate through **XMR** (Monero). You can read more about
Monero and it's advantages over other cryptocurrencies
[here](https://www.getmonero.org/).

I will probably add more donation options such as **Bitcoin** or **Paypal** in
the future, however Monero is the preferred currency due to its privacy
features.

# {{< big-icon dollar >}} Advantages for donators

Minimum donation for services: **0.2 XMR**

A one time donation grants you the following for **1 year**:
* Account on [Gitea](https://git.elpengu.com)
* Account on the Matrix homeserver [matrix.elpengu.com](https://element.elpengu.com)
* Email account with the format **name@â€Želpengu.com**
* **(Permanent)** Your name on this page and my gratitude :)

### Why do these services require a donation?
Simply because they take a lot of resources. **75%** of the server resources go
to these 3 services, so offering them to everyone would make it impossible to
sustain the server costs.

### After donating
To claim your services, contact me via [Email](mailto:contact@elpengu.com) or [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/@stefan911:matrix.elpengu.com), specifying the **payment proof** (transaction key).

### Terms
ElPengu promotes software freedom and anonymity online, thus some 
terms of service must be put in place to ensure operability while preserving
your anonymity.

Using ElPengu's private services, **you agree to**:
* Not engage in any illegal activites
* Not interrupt in any way the server's functionality (i.e. DoS, Spam etc.)
* Not disturb other ElPengu service users' experience
* Report any bugs found in the server's infrastructure

These terms are subject to change, but the main idea is: **use what's yours in
a way that does not destroy what's others'**. 

Breaking these terms may result in a temporary or permanent ban from using
ElPengu's private services.


# {{< big-icon bill >}} Hosting costs
**elpengu.com** is hosted at [OVH](https://www.ovhcloud.com/), on a regular
VPS. Hosting costs are around **280â‚¬** per year for the VPS and **12â‚¬** per year for
the DNS. I am a student, so I'm currently paying for these services from my own
money, so any donations are appreciated.

Donating helps me pay for hosting and allows me to expand VPS specifications,
in order to host more services and have better performance.
