Thank you for considering donating! ðŸ˜„

Currently, you can only donate through **XMR** (Monero). You can read more about
Monero and it's advantages over other cryptocurrencies
[here](https://www.getmonero.org/).

I will probably add more donation options such as **Bitcoin** or **Paypal** in
the future, however keep in mind that XMR is the best way to manage your money.

## Advantages of donators
A one time donation grants you access to the
[matrix.elpengu.com](https://element.elpengu.com) homeserver for **1 year**. Accounts on
the Matrix homeserver are restricted to donators due to the huge amount of
processing power and storage needed to mentain this service.

## Hosting costs
**elpengu.com** is hosted at [OVH](https://www.ovhcloud.com/), on a regular
VPS. Hostings costs are around **280â‚¬** per year for the VPS and **12â‚¬** per year for
the DNS. I am a student and I'm currently paying for these services from my own
money, so any donations are appreciated.

Donating helps me pay for hosting and allows me to expand VPS specifications,
in order to host more services and have better performance.
